Trizbort.io is now able to export maps to high-quality .PNG format. As a sample, [@john_metcalf](https://twitter.com/john_metcalf)'s map for Castle of Doom (ZX Spectrum 48K, Giant Byte, 1986) follows. This map was drawn in five minutes, then the "Obsidian" theme was applied to prettify it. Castle of Doom is a dark game, after all!
