_Humbug_ is a text adventure game created by Graham Cluley in 1990. It was 
Cluley's second and final text adventure, following _Jacaranda Jim_, and 
gained widespread attention when it appeared on the cover disk of PC Plus 
magazine in December 1990.

You play as Sidney Widdershins, sent to your grandfather's crumbling estate 
at Attervist Manor for the Christmas holidays. Upon arrival, you discover 
your grandfather mysteriously caught in an unwakeable slumber. Lurking in 
the shadows is Grandad's evil neighbour, Jasper Slake — a particularly 
sadistic dentist who is after the manor. Your quest: uncover the secrets of 
a hidden time machine, find buried treasure to save the estate, and wake your 
grandfather from his enchanted sleep.

The game features over 200 interactive objects and is filled with quirky characters, including an octopus performing rituals and a clockwork shark. _Strategy Plus Magazine_ praised it as "the most entertaining text adventure since Infocom's Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy," noting its "optimum balance of challenge, charm, silliness and sophistication."

While considerably more challenging than _Jacaranda Jim_, the game maintains a playful, witty tone throughout. Graham Cluley — now better known as a cybersecurity expert and blogger — placed _Humbug_ in the public domain in 1997, making it [free to download and play](https://archive.org/details/msdos_Humbug_1990).
