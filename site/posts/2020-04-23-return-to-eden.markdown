_Return to Eden_ is the second installment in Level 9's acclaimed Silicon Dreams trilogy, released in 1984. Following the events of _Snowball_, you play as Kim Kimberley, who has crash-landed on the planet Eden after escaping a sabotaged starship. Eden is a lush agricultural world maintained entirely by robots, but something has gone wrong: the robotic inhabitants now consider all humans to be vermin that must be exterminated.

The game is renowned for its rich world-building and clever puzzles. You must navigate Eden's diverse environments, from fungus farms to robot cities, while avoiding the mechanical guardians and uncovering the mystery behind the planet's hostility. Level 9 was famous for their advanced text compression technology, allowing them to pack remarkably detailed prose into the limited memory of 8-bit computers.

_Return to Eden_ remains a classic of the genre, showcasing the British developer's knack for combining science fiction storytelling with challenging gameplay.
