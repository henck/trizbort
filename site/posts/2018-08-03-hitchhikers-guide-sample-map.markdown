_The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy_ is a 1984 interactive fiction game written by Douglas Adams and Infocom's Steve Meretzky. It became one of the most celebrated text adventures ever made—selling 59,000 copies in its first year and topping 166,000 in 1985, making it Infocom's best-selling title.

The collaboration between Adams and Meretzky proved remarkably seamless. Though Adams originally wanted to program the game himself, he was paired with the more experienced Meretzky, who authored over half the content while matching Adams' distinctive comedic style so perfectly that Adams himself later admitted he couldn't tell which parts each had written.

The game is notorious for being both maddeningly difficult and brilliantly funny. The Babel Fish puzzle became so infamous that Infocom sold T-shirts proclaiming "I got the Babel Fish!" In 1996, Computer Gaming World ranked it #42 among their top 150 games of all time, and the BBC's 20th Anniversary Edition won the Interactive BAFTA Award for Best Online in 2004.
