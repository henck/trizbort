_The Colour Pink_ is a 2005 interactive fiction game by Robert Street, written in Inform 6. It placed 6th out of 36 entries in the 2005 Interactive Fiction Competition.

You play as a spaceman sent to investigate an out-of-contact colony on an abandoned planet. Your mission is to find out what happened to the scientists and report back to the Captain. But what do you do when the world turns pink and your communicator stops working?

The game features a clever morality system with seven different endings. You begin on the Path of Daedalus, where you're expected to solve problems in clever, peaceful ways under a pink sky. Choose violence or harmful solutions, and you'll shift to the Path of Diomedes—the fantasy world transforms accordingly, with the sky turning blood red. The puzzles are old-fashioned adventure fare: fiddling with machines, exchanging items, and conversing with NPCs through a multiple-choice dialogue system. Well-clued and not overly difficult, reviewers have praised it as "what adventure gaming is all about."
